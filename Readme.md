# [WIP] Data Science & Machine Learning Examples

This repository contains basic python code examples about different methods of data science and machine learning. This is a work in progress.

Current examples

- Linear regression
    - Simple and multiple, using `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels` libraries.
- Classifiers
    - Evaluation of binary classifiers, using `scikit-learn`
    - Logistic regression, using `scikit-learn`
